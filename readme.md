# C256 Foenix FMX Space Game #

This is a simple game or demo that I have started to show off some features of the C256 Foenix FMX.

At the moment, the game consists of a ship that can fly around the main screen and shoot a single torpedo.

## Controls ##

The game is controlled by an Atari style joystick in port 0.

## Demonstrated Features ##

* Tiles (the star field)
* Sprites (the ship and the torpedo)
* Joystick
* SN76489 sound chip
* Interrupts (start-of-frame or vertical blank interrupt is used to update Vicky registers and sound registers)
